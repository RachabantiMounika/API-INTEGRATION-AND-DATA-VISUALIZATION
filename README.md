**This program teaches us key concepts in API integration and data visualization. It demonstrates how to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API using Python's requests library, handling errors and extracting relevant information like temperature, humidity, and wind speed from the JSON response. The data is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for easy manipulation and organization. Finally, the program uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize this data in a bar plot, comparing weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the chosen city. By doing so, it shows how to integrate external APIs, process and structure data efficiently, and present that data visually for easier analysis and understanding. This process is essential for real-time data fetching, analysis, and communication of insights in a clear and accessible format.**
